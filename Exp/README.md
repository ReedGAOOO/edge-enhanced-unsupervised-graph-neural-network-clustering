# Experiment Artifact Policy

This repository does **not** track full experiment logs/results in Git.

## Optional cloud mirrors (fill with your own links)
- Experiment logs pack (Google Drive): `TODO`
- Experiment logs pack (Baidu Netdisk): `TODO`
- Processed result tables (Google Drive): `TODO`

## Suggested practice
Keep only compact summaries in Git (CSV/Markdown under a few MB),
and host heavy logs/checkpoints externally.
